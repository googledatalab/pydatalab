    """Initializes the core query parameters.

    The start time (exclusive) is determined by combining the
    values of "days", "hours", and "minutes", and subtracting
    the resulting duration from "end_time".

    It is also allowed to omit the end time and duration here,
    in which case the select_interval() method must be called
    before the query is executed.

    Args:
      metric_type: The metric type name. The default value is
          "compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/utilization", but
          please note that this default value is provided only for
          demonstration purposes and is subject to change.
      end_time: The end time (inclusive) of the time interval for which
          results should be returned, as a datetime object. The default
          is the start of the current minute.
      days: The number of days in the time interval.
      hours: The number of hours in the time interval.
      minutes: The number of minutes in the time interval.
      project_id: An optional project ID or number to override the one provided
          by the context.
      context: An optional Context object to use instead of the global default.

    Raises:
        ValueError: "end_time" was specified but "days", "hours", and "minutes"
            are all zero. If you really want to specify a point in time, use
            the select_interval() method.
